## Highlights

- **Complete Family Coordination Platform**: Multi-user system with family profiles, permissions, and personal dashboards
- **Advanced Task Management**: Drag & drop, recurring tasks, bulk actions, and visual assignment system
- **Comprehensive Meal Planning**: Recipe management, meal history tracking, nutritional analysis, and recipe reviews
- **Real-Time Features**: Live synchronization across devices with conflict resolution
- **Recipe Intelligence**: Usage analytics, rating systems, and meal rotation suggestions
- **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive layout with touch-optimized interactions
- **Accessibility-Focused**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support
- **Pluggable Architecture**: Local storage and backend API adapters with seamless switching

## Quickstart (development)

Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\kyle\projects\familydashboard
npm install
# optional: start the backend (recommended for full feature set)
npm run server
# in another shell: start the frontend dev server
npm run dev
```

The frontend runs at the Vite URL (usually http://localhost:5173). The dev server proxies `/api` to the backend at http://localhost:3001.

## Build

```powershell
npm run build
```

## Tests

```powershell
npx vitest run --reporter verbose
```

## Notes

- This project is a work-in-progress. The backend in `server/` is intended for local development and prototyping; it is not hardened for production.
- The DAL keeps the app pluggable: add methods to `IDataAccess` and implement in both adapters to extend storage capabilities.
